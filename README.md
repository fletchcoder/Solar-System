# Solar System
This is a solar system exploration site that showcases the planets of the solar system via Three.js 3D models. The planets are made using Three's Icosahedron geometry to create spheres and texture loader to put images on the spheres to make planets. Each planet can be rotated by holding left click and zoomed in and out on with the mouse wheel thanks to jsm OrbitControls. Each planet has rotation and axial tilt that is made to match their real life counterparts. Uses ideas from Bobbyroe's Threejs Earth Tutorial and planet textures from Planet Pixel Emporium.
